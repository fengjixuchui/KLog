/// @brief Marks a reset request
///
/// A reset request allows a reader to rotate a log without truncating a
/// block.  Reset requests are on a per-reader basis and work as follows:
///
/// * The reader sends this IOCTL, and the driver marks the reset request.
/// * The reader continues to read from the driver until it returns 0 bytes
///   read.  If there is no current block, the driver will return 0 bytes
///   read.  Otherwise, it will finish the current block.
/// * When the reader gets 0 bytes read, it closes its log and opens a new one.
/// * The reader reads from the driver.  The driver returns PCAP-NG section
///   header and interface description blocks, followed by blocks for all
///   of the running processes and open connections.  After that, it resumes
///   normal processing.
